*************************

### **Overview and Origin**

> Google Deepmind was originally founded in 2010 in the UK by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman. 
> Through many integrading parts, this concept eventually merged with Google AI's Google Brain becoming
> Deepmind in April of 2023. The two prime investors are Founders Fund and Horizons Ventures.[^1] As a leader in the
> world of technology it was inevitable that Google would grow to be a leader in the technology of Artificial Intelligence.

#### **Business Activities**

>The concept of utilizing the science of AI to fight climate change was not met without conflict. Large amounts of energy
>are needed in order to run an evergrowing amount of data centers.[^2] Human ingenuity is responsible for bringing AI to
>the forefront of fighting climate change. Utilizing our technology to protect our environment is what will allow AI to
>grow and evolve. A specific problem that Deepmind is trying to solve the energy sector is the transition to renewable
>energy. The unpredictability of renewable energy sources has posed a challenge from the begining. AI will be able to limit
>the uncertainty thereby making renewables less unreliable. The problem of energy storage is another conflict in this
>transition. By improving the grid resilience, energy shortages may become a thing of the past. AI can predict consumption
>patterns to more efficiently allocate resources. Lastly, AI is useful in predicting equiptment failures or when
>maitenance is needed which in turn will reduce repair costs and make the grid more reliable. [^4]
