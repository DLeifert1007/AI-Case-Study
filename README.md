### **Overview and Origin**

> Google Deepmind was originally founded in 2010 in the UK by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman. 
> Through many integrading parts, this concept eventually merged with Google AI's Google Brain becoming
> Deepmind in April of 2023. The two prime investors are Founders Fund and Horizons Ventures.[^1] As a leader in the
> world of technology it was inevitable that Google would grow to be a leader in the technology of Artificial Intelligence.

#### **Business Activities**

>The concept of utilizing the science of AI to fight climate change was not met without conflict. Large amounts of energy
>are needed in order to run an evergrowing amount of data centers.[^2] Human ingenuity is responsible for bringing AI to
>the forefront of fighting climate change. Utilizing our technology to protect our environment is what will allow AI to
>grow and evolve. A specific problem that Deepmind is trying to solve the energy sector is the transition to renewable
>energy. The unpredictability of renewable energy sources has posed a challenge from the begining. AI will be able to limit
>the uncertainty thereby making renewables less unreliable. The problem of energy storage is another conflict in this
>transition. By improving the grid resilience, energy shortages may become a thing of the past. AI can predict consumption
>patterns to more efficiently allocate resources. Lastly, AI is useful in predicting equiptment failures or when
>maitenance is needed which in turn will reduce repair costs and make the grid more reliable. [^4] These improvements
>along with companies working in the residential market can bring about great change. By working directly with homeowners
>to make the appropriate home modifications, these AI Advanced energy grids will be more efficient. A more recent AI driven
>technology know as DERMS, distributed energy resource management system, is a key player in the transition to renewable
>energy and away from the dependency on fossil fuels.[^5] 

##### **Landscape**

>Deepmind is in the field of Artifical Intelligence with a specific direction of building a more sustainable world with
>technology. The renewable energy transition requires not just social acceptance, updating the electrical grid, home
>installations, energy storage, weather predictions in wind and solar, but the technology to succesfully implement
>these changes. Deepmind has the drive to achieve this challenge.  

##### **Results**

>Google Deepmind is a leading competetor in the world of AI as well as in the transition to renewable energy. In
>a competition for computer programing, Deepmind ranked in the top 54%.[^6] Core metrics, or key performance
>metrics (KPM), are a method in which companies can measure their success. Accuracy, performance, and efficiency are
>what these metrics are based on. With more research comes more data and collectively this can improve gaps in the
>implementation of AI in renewable energy.[^7] The transition involves both the utilization of AI technology to better
>capture renewable resources as well as store the energy and distribute it effectively. Geothermal, wind, solar,
>bioenergy, and hydropower are the natural resources that will rid of us our dependency on fossil fuels.[^7] 


####### **Recommendations**

>A personal recommmendation directed to Google Deepmind, in the field of renewable energy, is to expand their approach.
>Transformers and the use of natural language would open AI to the energy consumer directly. Tips on how to get the most
>out of their energy grid would be an excitng interactive way to take part in the transition. Examples of this are
>thermostat interaction that regulates temperatures more efficiently or lights that work with motion detection. Deepmind
>is appropriate for the future of clean energy and environmental sustainability as it will bridge the gap between the idea
>renewable rescources and the actual full transition to utilize them.
